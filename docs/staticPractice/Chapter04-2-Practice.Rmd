## Exercise

1. Estimate the model from the previous practice exercises *with and without region variables*. Name your models `crime.lm1` (unrestricted model with regions) `crime.lmr` (restricted model without regions). 
$$\begin{aligned}ln(CrimeRate) ={} & \beta_0 + \beta_1ln(LawExpendPC) + \beta_2ln(IncomePC) + \beta_3ln(PopulationDensity) \\& + \beta_4West + \beta5Northeast + \beta_6South + u\end{aligned}$$  
2. Calculate the test statistic for the presence of risk-adjusted (controlling for other factors) regional differences in crime rates *by hand* using the restricted and unrestricted $R^2$. 
3. Calculate the corresponding p-value.
