## College GPA 

Simulate the bias term from the omitted variable bias formula, $E(\tilde\beta_1) = \beta_1 + \beta_2\delta$ for the model $CollegeGPA = \beta_0 + \beta_1HighSchoolGPA + \beta_2ACTScore + u$ using the $gpa1$ data. 

1. Define `beta.hat` as the coefficient vector (`coef()`) from the OLS estimates (`lm()`) of college GPA on ACT score and high school GPA and `delta.tilde` as the coefficient vector from the OLS estimates of high school GPA on ACT score. 
3. Calculate the formula for $\tilde\beta_1 = \hat\beta_1 + \hat\beta_2\hat\delta$. 
4. Produce a table summarizing the results for `beta.hat` and `beta.tilde` for the simple regression of college GPA on ACT Score.
